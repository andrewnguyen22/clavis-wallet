# Clavis Wallet
******************************************************************
GUI Wallet for BitcoinLatina

Version: 1.1 Alpha

Notes: Welcome all to the Clavis Wallet. This software is an Alpha
release and is generally untested. With that being said, there may
be some confusion on how to use this wallet. We hope to clear up 
that confusion here with a few points below:
******************************************************************

1.) Upon Installation you may be asked to let our wallet through
your firewall. This is normal behavior as our application must be
connected to the internet.

2.) **DO NOT** lose your password. This is a universal truth with
blockchain technology and if you lose your password, it cannot 
be recovered.

******************************************************************

How to Install:

MAC: Run "Clavis Wallet.dmg", drag Clavis Wallet to your Applications folder, and discard the DMG.

WIN: You may place the file 'Clavis Wallet.exe' wherever you like. 
It is recommended that you place it within your program files.
Double click to launch

LIN: Coming Soon!
